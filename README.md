# JamRadio
Audio player for Jamendo

# Purpose
I have found a wealth of great music on Jamendo but the website make it difficult to navigate the collections. I used an HTML based radio for a while that proved to be an ideal replacement but I lost track of it. This project is an attempt to make something similar and to practice coding in Ruby.
